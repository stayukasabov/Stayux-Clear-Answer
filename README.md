# Stayux-STE-linter

A fast, deterministic linter for **Simplified Technical English (STE)**, the
terse, unambiguous controlled-English style based on the ASD-STE100 standard.

## Two ways to use it

**1. Optimize the model's output, in the dialogue.**
For product managers, designers, and anyone who wants less verbose answers. Turn
STE mode on and Claude writes its replies in short, clear, controlled English.
One install, then `/ste-on`.

**2. Produce clearer documentation, on your own content.**
For developers and technical writers. Check, rewrite, and standardize technical
docs with `/ste-check`, `/ste-rewrite`, and `/ste-init`. A Desktop and API build
brings the same to non-developers.

Both share one core: a **Claude Code plugin** (the `ste-*` commands) and a
**zero-dependency Python linter** with a curated dictionary that act as the
objective pass/fail gate.

## Why

Most STE helpers are LLM-only: they load the rule set (and often a dictionary
reference) into the model's context and reason over it every turn. This project
moves the deterministic rules **and the substitution dictionary into Python**.
The model never holds them in context. It calls the linter as a subprocess and
reads back a small pass/fail result. So the rules and the dictionary cost **no
model-context tokens**, and the dictionary can grow toward the full standard
without adding any context cost. The AI layer only handles the judgment rules on
top.

To be precise about what *does* cost tokens: turning the skill on loads
`SKILL.md` once, and each draft-check adds a small lint round-trip. Those are
fixed and small. The part that scales, the rules and the ~900-word-scale
dictionary, stays out of context.

### Token economy (measured)

Counts use the `o200k_base` BPE tokenizer as a proxy for Claude's, which is not
public, so treat them as approximate, not exact.

| Item | Tokens | In model context? |
|---|---:|---|
| `ste-write` skill, loaded on `/ste-on` | ~745 | yes (once, sticky) |
| Lint round-trip, clean pass | ~50 | yes (per check) |
| Lint round-trip, many violations | ~270 | yes (per failing check) |
| Rule engine + dictionary + rules reference | ~3,455 | **no** (read by Python) |

The last row is the point: that material never enters the context window. An
LLM-only skill would load and reason over the equivalent every turn.

## What it checks

Deterministic rules (errors fail the gate):
- Sentence length (chat ≤ 25 words, full ≤ 20)
- Paragraph length (≤ 6 sentences; lists parsed separately)
- Semicolons (banned)
- Contractions (`don't` becomes `do not`)
- Progressive tense (`is running`) and perfect tense (`has done`)

Advisory (warnings that never fail the gate):
- Passive voice, phrasal verbs
- Joined imperatives (one instruction per sentence: no `and`/`then`)
- Unapproved words, with a suggested plain-English swap (curated seed map)
- Words removed from the ASD-STE100 word list (Issue 9)

## Install

Pick your client. Claude Code installs the plugin; Claude Desktop downloads the
skill.

### Claude Code (plugin)

The repo doubles as a plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add stayukasabov/Stayux-STE-linter
/plugin install stayux-ste@stayux
```

Commands:

- `/ste-on`, `/ste-off`: turn STE dialogue mode on or off. While on, the
  assistant drafts each reply, gates it through the linter, and rewrites until it
  passes.
- `/ste-mode off|prose|strict`: set strictness (prose uses the chat profile,
  strict uses the full profile).
- `/ste-check`: check a file or text and report the violations.
- `/ste-rewrite`: rewrite text into STE with a before and after.
- `/ste-init`: add STE rules to the project's CLAUDE.md.

The plugin also loads automatically when you mention STE. See the skill at
[`skills/ste-write/SKILL.md`](skills/ste-write/SKILL.md).

### Claude Desktop (download the skill)

No build needed. You download the ready skill and upload it once:

1. Download `stayux-ste.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/stayukasabov/Stayux-STE-linter/releases/latest).
2. In Claude Desktop or claude.ai, open **Settings > Capabilities > Skills** and
   upload the zip, then enable it.
3. Ask Claude to reply in STE, for example "reply in STE".

Custom skills need code execution, on the Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plans.
Full notes are in [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md).

## Before and after

The same question, answered with the skill off (Claude's normal prose) and on.

**You:** The API returns 502 sometimes right after a deploy. What should I check?

**STE off (default):**

> Intermittent 502s just after a deploy usually mean traffic reaches new
> instances before they are ready to serve it, so the first thing I would look
> at is your readiness checks and whether they genuinely reflect when the app
> can handle requests. Beyond that, it is worth confirming that the load
> balancer drains connections from the old instances gracefully during the
> rollout, and it can also help to review the logs from the first few seconds
> after each deploy, since that window is where this kind of race condition
> tends to show up.

**STE on:**

> Check three things.
> 1. Readiness probes. Confirm they pass only when the app can serve requests.
> 2. Connection draining. Make sure the load balancer removes old pods before it stops them.
> 3. Deploy timing. Look at the logs from the first 30 seconds after each rollout.

Same information. The STE reply is shorter, scannable, and faster to act on.

## The linter directly

The gate reads text on stdin (or `--text`) and prints a JSON result, exiting 1
if any error-severity violation is found:

```bash
echo "Commence the repair prior to the test." | python3 scripts/ste_lint.py --pretty
python3 scripts/ste_lint.py --profile full --text "Your sentence here."
```

Run the tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## The dictionary

The linter bundles a small, hand-authored **substitution map**
(`scripts/ste_dictionary.py`). It maps common non-STE words and phrases to plain
replacements, and lists terms removed from the standard. Entries marked
"Issue 9" were checked against the ASD-STE100 Issue 9 dictionary; the rest are
uncontroversial plain-English swaps.

It is **not** the official ~900-word list, which is copyrighted. Extend it two
ways:
- Add your own entries (including company technical terms).
- Point the tool at **your own** official ASD-STE100 copy and paste the approved
  words / substitutions into the maps. The official data is never shipped or
  committed.
